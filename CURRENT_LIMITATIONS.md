# Current Limitations

## required for 1.0
- [x] Interface type support
- [x] Nested input object support
- [x] Union type support
- [x] `mutation` or `subscription` operation support
- [ ] Object and list nullability support (seems like maybe a TypeScript bug right now?)
- [ ] Variable definition support

## perhaps in 1.x
- [ ] Field alias support
- [ ] Directive support
- [ ] Named fragments
- [ ] Custom scalar support yet (e.g no `Date` objects), limited to JS built-ins.
